Rules of coding:

Comment! Comment! Comment! Comment frequently and descriptively. Remember we are working as a group now and not on our own code. So we will have to read each other's code. This is also true for variable names.

Save and run your code frequently. You want to make sure your code works for every change you make. Basically, don't write 50 lines of code, then press the run button.

If there is an option to write the idea as an abstraction (object) Do it! Supposedly good abstractions should be less than 25 lines of code.

*Initial next to each edit, or if you want we can come up with nicknames, in the code so we can tell who did what/(who to blame when shit hits the fan) similar to below:

//PF: This is a comment

/* PF:

All of these

are comments.

*/
